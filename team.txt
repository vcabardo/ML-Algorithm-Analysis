All of us decided on which dataset we should use, the Dry Bean Dataset. Vensan Cabardo worked on the SVM classifiers,
with Camika Leiva working on the Decision Tree classifier and Likhitha Devineni implementing the Random Forest
classifier. As for how we implemented the classifiers, each of us fitted, trained and tested, and reported the metrics
of the classifiers -both through standard output and bar graphs.

Vensan Cabardo set up the skeleton for graphing the data of each classifier's metric with each dry bean species class,
and the rest filled in the information needed. Vensan Cabardo also cleaned up the code before submitting the finalized
code.

Regarding the report and who did which section:
	* Motivation was done by Vensan Cabardo and Camika Leiva.
	* Problem Statement was a team effort.
	* Dataset was decided as a team.
	* Proposed Solution was reported as a team.
	* Methodology was discussed and implemented as a team.
	* Results was written by Vensan Cabardo.
	* Dicussion was completed by Camika Leiva.
	* Conclusion was summarized by Likhitha Devineni.
	* Citations by Camika Leiva
	* Appendix by Vensan Cabardo and Likhitha Devineni.
The report was proofread and cleaned up by Camika Leiva, with triple checks being conducted by the rest of the team.

The leader role was held dutifully by Vensan Cabardo, who organized the meetings and planned each course of action 
for each stage of the project. All members communicated often and finished their respective parts of the project 
within the deadlines of each project stage. The team project was completed through GitHub, which allowed us to
share and update files whenever needed.
